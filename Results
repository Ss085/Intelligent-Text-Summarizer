----------------------------------------------- Summary -----------------------------------------------

Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines, in contrast to the natural intelligence displayed by humans and animals. Leading AI textbooks define the field as the study of "intelligent agents": any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals.

Artificial intelligence research is divided into subfields that focus on specific problems or on specific approaches. The central goals of AI research include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing (NLP), perception, and the ability to move and manipulate objects.
